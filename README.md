# CannaRec
## Description
This repository contains the Python code for an application that allows users to find new strains of cannabis based on current strains they like or flavor/physiological preferences. The fully functional website can be found at [www.cannarec.herokuapp.com](https://cannarec.herokuapp.com).

The application was designed using Dash and Pandas.

## Files
Here's a list of important files/folders in the directory:
- `app.py`: Contains the code to launch the application
- `view.py`: Contains the HTML layouts used in the Dash application
- `assets`: Contains the CSS, Javascript and other images used in the website

## Usage
In order to use the application, do the following:
1) Clone the repo
```
git clone https://github.com/mdylan2/cannarec.git
```
2) Navigate into the folder, set up a virtual environment and activate it
3) Once you've activated the virtual environment, install the requirements
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4) Launch the application
```
python app.py
```
> __**Note:**__ None of the app's tools will work because I have excluded those data files from the repo
